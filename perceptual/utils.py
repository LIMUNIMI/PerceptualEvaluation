def farthest_points(samples, k, n, optimize=False, method='A'):
    """
    Computes `n` sets of `k` indices of farthest points.

    First, it clusterizes `samples` with ward-linkage to find `k` clusters.
    Then, for each cluster, it looks for the `n` points which have the largest
    distance from the centroid of all the other points. The order of the `n`
    points in each cluster is randomized. This method ensure that each of the
    `n` sets contains one point in each cluster.

    Arguments
    ---------

    `samples` : np.ndarray
        the set of samples with dimensions (N, D), where N is the number of
        samples and D is the number of features for each sample

    `k` : int

    `n` : int
        the number of points per cluster to find

    `optimize` : bool
