<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this test, we will investigate how computers can represent musical performances. It will take about 15-20 minutes. Try to do this test in an environment as quiet as possible and use the best headphones/headset you have. Please, do not use your phone or laptop speakers.</p>
<p>First of all, let explain the meaning of two words to sake of this test.</p>
<p>Musicologists use the word <em>performance</em> to refer to the execution of a musical piece. For instance, Beethoven's 9th Symphony has been performed several times and in different concert halls. Imagine each performance being different from the others, even if the performers are the same; for instance, the orchestra director Arturo Toscanini performed the 9th Symphony several times with the NYC Orchestra, but in each recording, he played the same musical piece with some different musical feature.</p>
